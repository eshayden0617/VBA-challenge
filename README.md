# VBA-challenge
Use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. 

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
- The Ticker Symbol
- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a give year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The total stock volume of the stock.
- Add functionality to script to return the stock with the "Greatest % Increase", "Greatest % Decrease", and "Greatest Total Volume"
- Make the appropriate adjustments to VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once. 

Resources Utilized

- https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/vba-conditional-formatting/ - the exact code to use, as opposed to trying to for loop.
- ChatGPT for finding syntax errors in my code (commas in wrong place, undefined Ranges, etc.)
