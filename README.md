# VBA-challenge
Places I found help for this monster:
Tutor Kyle for setting up my initial code/remind me to set every loop to zero. Ultimately ended up losing the first version of this code but having it Zoom recorded helped me rebuild it.
Friend who works with VBA to remind me of the SummaryRow function
FizzBuzz to remind me the order of which the loop should go to keep everything lined up
CensusData exercise to remind to use the <> 0 function so data wasnâ€™t just missing
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/replace-function - used to find the Greatest % Increase/Decrease
Stefan for talking through conditional formatting and Wall Street MOJO setting up the conditional formatting 
https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/vba-conditional-formatting/ - the exact code to use, as opposed to trying to for loop.
ChatGPT for finding syntax errors in my code (commas in wrong place, undefined Ranges, etc.)
